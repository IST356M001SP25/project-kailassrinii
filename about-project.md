### What it does
This Syracuse concert tracker scrapes live event data from the Ticketmaster API and saves it into a JSON file. Each time the app runs, it refreshes the data so the map and concert listings are always current. The app lets users filter events by date and artist, and it displays concert locations on an interactive map using Folium.

For the design, I customized the sidebar and main layout with HTML and CSS to make it look more modern and clean. Iâ€™ve had internships in the past where I worked with web design, so I was able to apply some of that experience here.
